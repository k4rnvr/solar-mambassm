# Solar Power Forecasting

This project demonstrates how to use Mamba-SSM to forecast solar power generation based on historical data. It combines a set of Parquet files with a Jupyter Notebook that processes, analyzes, and models the data.

## Files

- `solarPV_MambaSSM.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook with EDA, model training, and evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset includeswas taken from NIST Campus Photovoltaic (PV) Arrays and Weather Station Data Sets
One-minute averaged values for 2017 for three grid-connected photovoltaic arrays on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland USA.

All files were converted into Apache Parquet format for 12 months for optimized performance
